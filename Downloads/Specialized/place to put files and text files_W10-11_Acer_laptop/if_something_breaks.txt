if something breaks its either 1 of 3

1. ur just too dumb to do this. 
2. a fatal error has occurred.
3. god themselves has striked you, causing a bitflip, crashing your computer.

not to worry, we have solutions for all.

1. email us at strawberrycroissant@outlook.com and ask for a developer to help with the installation.
  1.1. In your email, you must include: 1. Date and time you can call us. 2. What version you are installing (optimised or generic), your serial number, and what problems you face.

2. email us the fatal error. we recommend you just remove the usb and reinstall it. If it still dosent work, follow the email instructions in 1.1.

3. reinstall the iso and drivers from the website. if it still dosent work, email us and follow the email instructions in 1.1.


none of the above? its probably 1.

anyways just email us if u need anything
